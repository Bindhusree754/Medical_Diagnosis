# Medical_Diagnosis
To Develop and evaluate machine learning models, specifically logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM), for the accurate and simultaneous prediction of multiple chronic diseases (heart disease, lung disease, thyroid disorders, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes) using diverse patient datasets. The project aims to assess the feasibility and performance of these algorithms in identifying individuals at risk for these conditions, contributing to early detection and preventative healthcare strategies.
